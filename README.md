# Eventop Subscription Protocol

A Solana-based subscription management system that enables recurring crypto payments while maintaining full custody and earning yield on idle funds.

## What is Eventop?

Eventop brings crypto's original promise to subscriptions: true on-chain recurring payments where users keep custody of their funds, earn yield on idle balances, and merchants accept crypto subscriptions without blockchain complexity.

## Why Eventop?

**For Users:**
- **Full Custody**: Funds stay in your subscription wallet, not in centralized platforms
- **Earn Yield**: Idle subscription funds automatically generate 5-8% APY through integrated DeFi protocols
- **Cancel Anytime**: Your funds remain accessible窶馬o refund requests or waiting periods

**For Merchants:**
- **Simple Integration**: RESTful API and JavaScript SDK窶馬o blockchain knowledge required
- **Global Reach**: Accept payments from anyone, anywhere, instantly
- **Lower Costs**: No payment processor fees, chargebacks, or failed card transactions

## Key Features

### Subscription Wallets
Virtual cards for managing recurring payments with optional yield earning on idle funds

### Multi-Protocol Yield Integration
Earn returns through integrated DeFi protocols:
- Kamino(coming soon)

### Configurable Protocol Fees
Maximum 1% fee on all transactions with transparent fee structure

### Merchant Plans
Create and manage multiple subscription tiers with flexible pricing

### Automated Payments
Smart contracts execute recurring payments on schedule窶馬o manual intervention needed

## Core Program Instructions

| Instruction | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `initialize_protocol` | Set up protocol configuration and admin settings |
| `create_subscription_wallet` | Create a virtual wallet (PDA) for managing subscriptions |
| `enable_yield` | Activate yield earning on wallet funds via DeFi protocols |
| `deposit_to_wallet` | Add funds to your subscription wallet |
| `withdraw_from_wallet` | Withdraw funds from your subscription wallet |
| `register_merchant` | Create merchant account and subscription plans |
| `subscribe_with_wallet` | Start a subscription using wallet funds |
| `execute_payment_from_wallet` | Process recurring subscription payments |
| `cancel_subscription_wallet` | End subscription (funds remain in wallet) |
| `claim_yield_rewards` | Withdraw earned yield from DeFi protocols |

## How It Works

1. **Users Create Subscription Wallets**: signup vai the mobile app, and your Solana wallet and subscription wallet are automtically created for you. Deposit funds and optionally enable yield earning.

2. **Subscribe to Services**: Browse website subscription plans and subscribe with one click. The protocol automatically reserves a payment buffer (typically 3 months) while the rest continues earning yield.

3. **Automatic Payments**: Smart contracts execute payments on schedule with full transparency and user control.

4. **Merchants Receive Payments**: Funds flow directly to merchant wallets on-chain窶馬o intermediaries or custody risk.
